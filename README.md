# Local-Food-Wastage-Management-System-
 The Local Food Wastage Management System is a full-stack data application designed to combat food waste and food insecurity by creating a structured platform for food redistribution. This project provides a digital bridge connecting food surplus from households and restaurants with NGOs and individuals in need.
