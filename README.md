# Local Food Wastage Management System üçé‚ôªÔ∏è

This project is a web-based application built with **Streamlit** and **SQLite** to combat food waste and food insecurity. It provides a platform for food providers to list surplus food and for receivers to find available donations, creating a digital bridge for efficient food redistribution.

## Key Features

-   **Interactive Dashboard:** Provides a quick, at-a-glance overview of key metrics such as total available food, the number of providers, and the number of receivers, presented in a clean, card-based format.
-   **Detailed Analysis:** A dedicated page with a comprehensive collection of dataframes providing in-depth insights into providers, claims, and distribution patterns.
-   **Food Listings:** Browse, filter, and search through available food listings using a user-friendly, card-based interface with collapsible details.
-   **Provider Actions:** A secure section for providers to easily **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete their food listings.
-   **SQL Query Runner:** An advanced feature that allows users to run custom SQL queries directly against the database for powerful, on-demand data exploration.
